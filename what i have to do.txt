🎯 Project Brief:
Build a "Personal Dashboard" with multiple components, full state control, data rendering via .map, user interactivity, styling, and conditional logic.

🔧 Core Requirements (All Must Be Met)
✅ Structure & Component Hierarchy
App (root)

Header (e.g. shows current time or greeting)

Navigation (conditionally highlights active section)

Main

Section: To-Do List

Section: Joke Viewer

Section: Contact Cards

Footer

✅ To-Do Section
Checkbox list with task text

Toggle completed state

Strike-through styling when completed

Task data stored in state

Use .map() to render

✅ Joke Viewer Section
Display one joke at a time

Jokes come from an array (props)

“Next Joke” button cycles through

If question is missing, only render punchline

✅ Contact Card Section
Render contact cards from array

Each card displays image, name, phone, email

Use .map() + props

Style with a clean grid layout

🧠 Logic & State
Store data in state, not external variables

Each section must render dynamically based on data

Navigation sets state to control active section

Conditional rendering for hiding/showing sections

🖌 Styling
Use CSS + className

Use inline styles for at least one dynamic element

Use camelCase in style objects

📋 Bonus (Push Difficulty)
Count completed tasks

Button to clear all completed

Responsive layout

Dynamic greeting in Header based on time of day (Good morning, etc.)

🚫 Not Allowed (yet)
No hooks

No context

No external packages

No async data

No routing

Why This Works
Every line must use what you know:

Functional + class components

State + props

Mapping, conditionals, styling

Event handling

File structure discipline
